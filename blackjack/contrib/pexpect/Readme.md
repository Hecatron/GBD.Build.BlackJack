## Overview

Pexpect is a library using for calling external process's and interacting with them
https://pexpect.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html

## Windows Support

The current version 3.3 unfortunately doesn't appear to support windows, although this does appear to be planned
in version 4.0

The version I'm using here is wexpect from this source, which seems to be windows / unix compatible
Also I've patched the source here for use within python 3.x
