This is WinPexpect, a version of pexpect that works on windows.

At the moment it includes a modified copy of pexpect, but the goal is to
get this merged upstream and to stop winpexpect as a separate project.

Installation via setuptools:

  $ python setup.py install

To run the tests, you need Nose [1]. To run them, use:

  $ python setup.py test
