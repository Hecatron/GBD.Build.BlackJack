# Project Dependencies

## Overview

I've put together a list of other projects I'll be depending on and using here

## CMake

All of the heavy lifting of project file generation, such as generating ninja / make files / VS Project files
will be handled via CMake, we're just adding a front end to provide an alternative to the CMake syntax normally used
within the CMakeFiles.txt file (in that we generate one from a seperate .cs file instead)
