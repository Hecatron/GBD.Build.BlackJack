# Example Use Cases

## Overview

To give some examples on some use cases / how this will fit together

## End User

For the first example a user wants to compile an existing project using CMake
In this first example we use dotCMake to do the CMake stage

* End user runs dotCmake (managed exe)
* dotCMake runs a clean of any cached CMake files
* The CMakeFile.cs file is parsed / run via mono and CS-Script
* The CMakeFile.cs file makes calls to the dotCMakeGenerator library
* The CMakeFile.txt file is output / generated
* dotCmake then automatically called cmake to generate the project build files
* The user calls make or whichever command needed to buid the project

In this second example the CMakeFile.txt files have been pre-generated by the end developer

* End user runs cmake as normal
* The existing CMakeFile.txt which has already been pre-generated by the developer is parsed
* The user calls make or whichever command needed to buid the project

## Developer

In this example a Developer wants to make changes to the build script

* Developer opens CMakeFile.cs with they're favoured development environment, this can include
* Visual Studio with CS-Script Extension
* MonoDevelop
* Editing the script manually with vim / running it with CS-Sharp manually

At this stage there are a couple of different options

The developer can pre-generate the CMakeFile.txt and check it into the source control repo
using dotCMake to generate the file. This approach is more portable since the end user doesn't need a copy of mono
or CS-Script installed to proceed with the CMake stage

Another approach is to rely on the use of dotCMake for more complex logic during the generation of the CMake files
This has the upside of allowing more of the logic to be based within the C# Script, but the downside of being less
portable (since mono and CS-Script become part of the project depends).
